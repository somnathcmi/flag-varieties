Consider the Pl\"{u}cker embedding of the Grassmannian, $Gr(3,7)$, of three dimensional subspaces of a seven dimensional space in projective space ${\mathbb P}(\bigwedge^3 {\mathbb C}^7 )$. Consider the action of the maximal torus of diagonal matrices in $SL(7,{\mathbb C})$ on $Gr_{3,7}$. We give a computational proof that the GIT quotient of $Gr_{3,7}$  is projectively normal. Our computations rely on the connection between generators of rings of invariants under the action of a torus and Hilbert basis of polyhedral cones. 
We describe the geometry of the torus quotient of partial flag varieties, $SL(5,{\mathbb C})/Q$, when $Q$ is the 
intersection of two maximal parabolic subgroups of $SL(5,{\mathbb C})$ containing a Borel subgroup. The proofs are computational, based again on computing generators for rings of 
invariants using the connection to Hilbert basis of polyhedral cone. However, unlike in $Gr_{3,7}$, these results can in principle be checked by hand.
