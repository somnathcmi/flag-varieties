Consider the Pl\"{u}cker embedding of the Grassmannian of three dimensional subspaces of a seven dimensional space, $Gr_{3,7}$, in projective space ${\mathbb P}(\bigwedge^3 {\mathbb C}^7 )$. The maximal torus of diagonal matrices in $SL(7,{\mathbb C})$ acts on $Gr_{3,7}$ and so it is natural to seek geometric properties of the GIT quotient of $Gr_{3,7}$ with respect to this action. Using the notation ${\mathcal L}(\omega_3)$ for the line bundle on $Gr_{3,7}$ coming from its Pl\"{u}cker embedding, it is known that the twisted line bundle ${\mathcal L}(7\omega_3)$ descends to the GIT quotient. We show that the GIT quotient is projectively normal for this polarization.  Some parts of our proof are computational and rely on code which computes generators of the ring of torus invariants and implements the standard monomial theory which arises in this situation. We compute the generators of the ring of torus invariants by computing the Hilbert basis of certain polyhedral cones. 
 In this paper we also begin a study of the torus quotients of $SL(5,{\mathbb C})/Q$, when $Q$ is the 
intersection of two maximal parabolic subgroups in $SL(5,{\mathbb C})$ containing a Borel subgroup. We describe the GIT quotient explicitly in some cases and prove geometric properties of the embedding of the quotient when the line bundle descends to it.
