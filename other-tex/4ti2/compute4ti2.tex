\subsection{Computation of Hilbert basis using \texttt{4ti2}. }

The software package \texttt{4ti2} ('fourtytwo or for tea too') implements hilbert basis computation algorithm given in paper 'On the Computation of Hilbert Bases and Extreme Rays of Cones' (https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203105). Using this implementation, we computed hilbert basis for chains in \(Gr(3,7)\). Following are the observations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
        There are 462 maximal chains in bruhat poset and 131 out of them do not admit T-invariants.
    \item 
        Maximum degree of the element which cannot be directly splitted is 3.
\end{enumerate}

Data will be uploaded soon on github.
