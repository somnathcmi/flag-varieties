    \subsection{Notations}

    We will start with few notations required along the way. 
    Let \(\SC = p_1< \cdots < p_l\) be a chain in Bruhat poset. 
    Denote by \(STab(r,n,\SC)\) the set of all torus-invariant tableaux in chain \(\SC\).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For \(p \in \SC\) denote by \(u_p\), 
            the \(n\)-dimentional indicator vector defined as follows:
            For \(1 \le i \le n\), \(u_p(i)\) is defined as follows:
            \[
                u_p(i) = \left\{
                \begin{array}{lr}
                    1 & i \in p\\
                    0 & i \not\in p\\
                \end{array}\right.
            \]
            Here tuple \(p\) is treated as set.
        \item We will construct matrix \(A'\) of order \( n \times l \). 
            Entries of \(A'\) are indexed by tuple \((i,p)\) where \(1 \le i \le n\) and 
            \(p \in \SC\).
            \(A'\) is constructed as follows:
            \[
                A'_{(i,p)} = \left. 
                \begin{array}{c}
                    u_p(i)
                \end{array} \right.
            \]
            We call \(A'\) the indicator matrix of chain \(\SC\). 
            Note that \(p^{th}\) column of \(A'\) is \(u_p\), the indicator vector of \(p\in\SC\).
        \item Let \(w \in \IR^n\) be a vector defined as follows:
            \[
                w = \left[
                \begin{array}{c}
                    -r \\
                    -r \\
                    \vdots \\
                    -r \\
                \end{array} \right]
            \]
            We construct one more matrix denoted by \(A\), defined by
            \[ A = [A'|w]. \]
            Call this matrix the augmented indicator matrix of chain \(\SC\).
            Let \(P_{\SC} = ker(A)_{_{\ge 0}}\).
        \item For column-standard tableau \(S\) whose columns are in \(\SC\),
            define a column vector \(v'_{_S}\) of length \(l\), 
            indexed by set \([l]\) (or \(\SC\)), as follows:
            \[
                v'_{_S}(i) = \left.
                \begin{array}{lr}
                    \text{number of times }p_i\text{ appear in }S\text{ as column} 
                \end{array}\right.
            \]
            Observe that:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item For \(p \in \SC\), \(v'_{p}(q) = \delta_{pq}\).
                \item If \(S\) and \(T\) are two tableaux and \(ST\) is tableau obtained 
                    by appending \(T\) to \(S\), then
                    \[v'_{_{ST}} = v'_{_S} + v'_{_T}.\]
            \end{enumerate}
        \item For torus-invarient semi-standard tableau \(S\) in \(\SC\), 
            define a column vector \(v_{_S}\) of length \(l+1\), 
            indexed by set \([l+1]\), as follows:
            \[
                v_{_S}(i) = \left\{
                \begin{array}{lr}
                    v'_{_S}(i)          & i \le l\\
                    \text{degree of }S  & i = l+1 
                \end{array}\right.
            \]
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item If \(S\) and \(T\) are two tableaux and \(ST\) is tableau obtained 
                    by appending \(T\) to \(S\), then
                    \[v_{_{ST}} = v_{_S} + v_{_T}.\]
            \end{enumerate}
        \item For non-negative integer vector \(v = [u|d]^t \in \IR^{l+1}\) 
            where \(u \in \IR^l,d \in \IR\), define tableau \(T^v\) such that
            \[v'_{_{T^v}} = u\]
        \item Weight of column-standard tableau \(S\), denoted by \(wt(S)\), 
            is \(n\)-tuple \((a_1,...,a_n)\) such that \(i\) appear \(a_i\) times in \(S\).
            We will think of \(wt(S)\) as vector in \(\IR^n\).
            Observe that:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item If \(S\) contain only one column \(p\) then 
                    \[wt(S) = u_p.\]
                \item If \(S\) and \(T\) are two tableaux and \(ST\) is tableau obtained 
                    by appending \(T\) to \(S\), then
                    \[wt(ST) = wt(S) + wt(T).\]
                \item \(S\) is torus-invarient of degree \(d\) iff weight of \(S\) is \(-dw\).
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
